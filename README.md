# Forest Monitoring System

This is my small project of **Smart Forest Monitoring System**. This repository include the _ESP8266 MCU_ program and the  Website Dashboard code in HTML. The Hardware circuit includes different sensors which sense the real-time condition of forest and send data over cloud. The website is connected to the hardware circuit using **_ThingSpeak IoT Cloud_**.

Sensors/components required :
* Esp8266 MCU
* Flame Sensor
* MQ2 Gas Sensor
* DHT11 -Temperature and Humidity Sensor
* Rain Sensor
